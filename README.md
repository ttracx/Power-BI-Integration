# Power BI Integration

Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft. It aims to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.

This skill wraps a subset of the REST endpoints available on the Power BI Service REST interface. Additional endpoints are available on the service and may be added to this skill in the future.
